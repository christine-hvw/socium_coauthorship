# The Formation of Co-authorship Networks - A Case Study of the SOCIUM Research Institute

## Summary

This study aims at counteracting the neglect of social science co-authorship practices in the literature by accessing the complete scientific publication data of a well-established research center at the University of Bremen. The dataset encompasses a network of 240 authors over the course of ten years (2010-2019). Alongside the bibliographic entries, several other features to investigate the generative process behind this case of co-authorship were encoded during the data collection process. To account for the interdependent as well as temporal nature of the data, I employ the temporal version of an exponential random graph model (TERGM) to explain the emergence of co-authorship, i.e., the formation of ties in this network.
